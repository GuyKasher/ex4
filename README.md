I pledge the highest level of ethical principles in support of academic excellence.  I ensure that all of my work reflects my own abilities and not those of someone else.

Q:
I will check if we are in test mode or regular running mode, and will send with new broadcast intent to the CalculateRootService the max runnig time.
With this solution I makes sure that the tests time will be short.
